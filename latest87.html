                        Some of the best films of all time are those whose different strengths all work in concert to create a unified, engrossing whole. The Shining, The Social Network, and Jaws are all excellent examples of films made up of strong individual parts complementing each other to form a fantastic work of art. That is absolutely true of God of War – its musical score elevates story moments, which flow seamlessly into fantastic action gameplay, which facilitates exploration and puzzles that reward you with a deeper understanding of its characters and its expansive and beautiful world. God of War is a masterful composition of exceptional interlocking parts, deliberate in its design and its foreshadowing, which pays off in unexpected ways in both the gameplay and story.
                    <br><br>
                    If you’ve played the previous games in the series – seven of them, counting two PSP games and one mobile game – you know that Kratos lived a long life of loss, triumph, and plenty of god-killing in ancient Greece. While that history certainly informs who he is now, the character we encounter here has started a new chapter, having found love, a family, and a full bushy beard in this world of Norse mythology. But he is still a stranger to this place, and is forced to rely on the son he barely connects with to decipher its languages and guide him when the swing of an axe or the imprint of his boot on an undead foe won’t do the trick.<br><br>
                    That relationship, and how it evolves and changes over the course of the story, is one of God of War’s most captivating qualities. Here are two people with demonstrably different personalities, one of them young and still innocent, the other old and as blood-soaked as they come, both grieving over the same woman in different ways. Kratos loves his son but is cold at first. He seems disappointed in his lack of skill and stomach for combat, referring to him mostly as “Boy,” and rarely making eye or physical contact with him. (He will, of course, unflinchingly beat the life out of anyone who threatens his son, which appears to be the only way he knows how to express affection.) Kratos’ uncertainty of how to relate to a boy he’s both looking to turn into a survivor and yet afraid may turn out like him is devastating to watch. 
                    <br><br>
                    I have audibly said “wow” and sighed at the beauty of God of War. The texture of grassy hills in the distance feel real, light dances dazzlingly off of shinier surfaces, and every gnarled monster I have fought conveys such a sense of decay as to instill terror in me. Even the sky looks nearly photo-realistic. And while the beautiful landscapes captivated me, the small details on Kratos and Atreus stunned me. The fur and leather of their outfits move so naturally, and are so finely detailed that they look nearly genuine. I would find myself trying on new pieces of armor just to admire how Kratos’ outfits behaved.
                    <br><br>
                    I expected great action from God of War, and it delivers that handily. But I didn’t expect it to be a thrilling journey in which every aspect of it complements the others to form what is nothing short of a masterpiece. It’s a game in which Kratos, a previously one-note character, becomes a complex father, warrior, and monster, embattled both on the field and within his own heart about how to treat his son; one in which the world opens up and shifts, offering rewards in both gameplay and knowledge of its lore that I treasured with each accomplishment. The obvious care that went into crafting its world, characters, and gameplay delivers by far the most stirring and memorable game in the series.<br><br>

                    Warrior Within takes place several years after the events of The Sands of Time. The Prince, having originally released the Sands, is being hunted by the Dahaka, guardian of the timeline. The Dahaka is a massive dark warrior that serves fate and will pursue the Prince until he is dead. Desperate and weary from the years of running, the Prince makes a final play, heading to the Island of Time. The hope is that if the Prince can somehow go into the past, he can stop the Empress before she ever creates the Sands of Time, meaning he would never have opened them and the Dahaka would have no cause for its hunt.<br><br>
                    The premise certainly sounds good and the story of Warrior Within has more complexity than the simpler fable of The Sands of Time. Ubisoft chose to use this story to darken the Prince, draping him in a morose take-crap-from-no-one attitude, changing voice actors to provide the Prince with an edgy Clint Eastwood snarl, and giving him such novel lines as, "You bitch!" No, this is not Sands of Time, this is the new Prince of Persia and the idea of a dark character, dark atmosphere, and dark story are forced down your throat from start to finish. It's too much, too forced, and frankly, not as appealing as the Prince of old. From a thematic perspective, it's a step backwards, even though the gameplay remains excellent. 
                    <br><br>
                    Anyone who's played through The Sands of Time will have few problems handling the platforming tasks of Warrior Within. Though two new trap types have been added and the need for slowing time is more prevalent, you won't be asked to do anything you haven't done in last year's Prince of Persia. Run on walls, leap off onto a bar, swing and jump against another wall, bounce off and upward, grab onto a ledge and pull yourself to the top. I could do it in my sleep by now, but I still love it, because no other game has platforming quite like this. The major difference between Sands and Warrior Within is the sense of urgency when platforming. Sands had a lot of crumbling beams and platforming puzzles that forced you to be reactive, where Warrior Within is a bit more laid back, concentrating those types of intense moments into short bursts. On the one hand, this makes a sepia-toned chase scene where you must run from the Dahaka more exhilarating. But since you only get about a half dozen or so chase sequences in the entire game, it would have been nice to see more instances where quick reactions were vital to survival.<br>
                    <br>
                    Combat in the first few hours of Warrior Within is pretty awesome, because it's all very new and there are so many ways to earn slow-motion close-ups of gruesome death blows. With the large variety of enemies and more than 60 weapons at your disposal, there is plenty to keep you occupied. But after a few hours, I started getting tired of the battles, just as I did in The Sands of Time. I don't care about fighting more and more enemies, no matter how cool it may look, it's the platforming and the puzzles and even the story that make Prince compelling. Eventually I just started grabbing enemies and throwing them over ledges to get rid of them quickly. Fortunately, there are some good boss fights mixed in throughout Warrior Within that refresh the combat. The brutes, who are flesh and sand goliaths that tower over the Prince, are an awesome challenge. The Crow King is a cool-looking foe, though he's never given any context in the game as to why he exists or what his purpose is other than dying by your blade. The big fights come against a few different women, all of whom share the same set of combos. It's pretty damn cheap when you fight two different characters a total of four times and each fight is the same with some wrinkles (i.e. Time Powers) here and there. Still, the final boss fight is at least a challenge and victory is certainly satisfying.
                    <br><br>
                    The sound may be ugly, but the game is beautiful. The bloom lighting of the first POP made for an almost ethereal experience and Warrior Within is the exact opposite. Things are dark and dirty, with the Prince looking more menacing than some of the enemies he faces. Love or hate the look, it's hard to argue the stunning visuals. The architecture in some areas is amazing and the Garden Tower feels like the seventh wonder of the world..<br>
                    <br>
                    Prince of Persia: Warrior Within has lost some of the marvel that made The Sands of Time one of the great games of this generation. Despite this, it retains the core gameplay of Sands, improves the combat, and adds substantial length to the gameplay. The majority of those who enjoyed The Sands of Time will like Warrior Within, but a few may find the overly dark look a bit too much of a departure from the series' roots. Ubisoft Montreal needs to realize that people play prince for the sense of swashbuckling adventure, not for the combat. If anything, I'd like a combat system that pits the Prince against just one or two enemies at a time, but matches the intensity of a fighting game.
