                    Valorant is a game released by Riot Games in June 2020 with the genre as a shooting game. Released during worldwide lockdwon period, this game quickly gained attention of players, for its similar to Counter-Strike base and the introduction of characters, each with their own special ability matching with their personality. The creators have been adding buffs, new modes, locations and characters after fixed intervals of time to maintain the interest of the users. New promising story modes are rumoured to be added within a span of a few years, making the game similar to COD in many aspects. Stay tuned to Valorant to get access to these future updates.
                    <br><br>
                    It's wild how quickly Valorant has captured the collective consciousness of FPS fans. Riot's competitive shooter is just barely out of beta, yet it already stands toe-to-toe with the biggest games in its genre. It helps that Valorant comes from a gigantic studio and that its deviously smart partnership with Twitch streamers to selectively hand out beta access gave it a running start. But that enormous marketing push wouldn't mean much if Valorant weren't also very good. 
                    <br><br>
                    It's true that Valorant is Riot's best crack at Counter-Strike, but the ways it remixes Valve’s blueprint are what make it excellent. Anonymous gangs of counter-terrorists are replaced by a cast of vibrant agents with talents that match their personalities. In a very Overwatch fashion, agents quip at each other at the start of rounds and break the fourth wall to announce they've eliminated their "imposter" on the other team (the enemy playing the same character). It has the same upbeat vibe of Overwatch that helps every loss feel a little more friendly.
                    <br><br>
                    The 5v5 games take place over up to 25 rounds, which can last anywhere from 10 seconds to a couple minutes each. The attackers want to plant the bomb (called the Spike here) and the defenders have to defuse it or die trying. Other games have borrowed Counter-Strike's round-based bomb mode over the years, but far fewer have ever mimicked Counter-Strike's exact shooting style, map design, and weapon economy. Even in 2020, CS still stands out as a shooter that's won with equal parts mechanical skill, strategic frugality, and deep mind games.

                    My first Warzone win was full of highs and lows that I haven’t felt in other battle royale games, where dying can feel like hitting an invisible wall in the middle of a full sprint. <br>
                    <br>
                    After winning a few early fights in the TV Station, we all died to an enemy ambush and got sent to the Gulag. Amazingly, we all won our 1-on-1 fights and dropped right back into action. From there, we stuck to the shadows and slowly raised funds to call in our favorite custom loadouts. With my tried-and-true M4A1 kitted with a full suite of attachments, I ended with nine kills for a squad total of 20. For as much as Call of Duty: Warzone borrows from the best of its competition, it’s full of smart conveniences that are quickly making it my circle-shrinking murderfest of choice.<br>
                    <br>
                    A lot of it has to do with Warzone’s relaxed take on looting. Nothing turns me off battle royale more than spending 20 minutes fiddling with weapons, ammo, and attachments in and out of menus until I've reached a meta-approved level of battle readiness. That’s not how Warzone rolls. There are no backpacks—there’s barely even an inventory screen.<br>
                    <br>
                    Battle royale feels like the main mode in the Warzone package, but there’s another mode on offer that’s in a different genre entirely. Plunder takes place on the same Verdansk map, but there’s no circle, no Gulag, and infinite free respawns. The only goal is to make a bunch of money through killing players and completing contracts. You could compare it to a raid in Escape From Tarkov, but it’s actually closer to the The Division’s PvP Dark Zone mode.<br>
                    <br>
                    Plunder is undeniably more casual than Battle Royale. Even though you’re supposed to be making money, you can treat it as an aimless playground to practice shooting, grind levels for your weapons, or drive ATVs off sick ramps. It’s a great chaser to a tense round of battle royale.<br>
                    <br>
                    There’s a lot to love about Warzone. The ways it limits the randomness of loot and simplifies inventory addresses two of my biggest problems with the battle royale genre. Warzone wants victory to be decided by smart positioning and twitch shooting skill, not your armor tier. The only downside to Warzone’s less-complex loot landscape is a meta that’s potentially too shallow to stay interesting. Infinity Ward has aggressively updated Modern Warfare since its release last year, so I have hope that Warzone will continue to grow as its own standalone game, attention it will need if it's to compete with the likes of Fortnite and Apex Legends.<br>
