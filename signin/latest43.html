                        In amongst its frantic combat, slick parkour, and outrageous action choreography, Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End achieves something wonderful: maturity. This is less a breezy lad’s tale revelling in fortune and glory and more a story about the lads when they’re all grown up, bolstered by an equally developed graphics engine and career-high performances from its cast. A surprisingly assured set of multiplayer modes ices the cake.<br>
                        <br>
                        What lets it down, however, is an uninspired and overly long third act which slows down its pace considerably with curiously repetitive gameplay. Uncharted 4 consequently falls short of the greatness achieved by some of developer Naughty Dog’s leaner, more inventive predecessors.<br>
                        <br>
                        Somehow, the visuals keep up with it all. Unlike past Uncharted games where very strict linearity allowed for very carefully orchestrated beauty between stretches of more utilitarian sections built for action, Uncharted 4 manages to be all gorgeous, all the time. The big vistas are predictably impressive, but it’s the little details that really astound: the way snow settles on Nate’s hair, the shocking green of an underwater plant, the reflection cast off of an oil painting. The regularity of such beauty borders on ridiculous: it may be capped at 30 frames per second, but this is the prettiest game I’ve ever played.<br>
                        <br>
                        Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End is a remarkable achievement in blockbuster storytelling and graphical beauty. Though it’s let down by a lack of imagination and some self-indulgence, especially in a third act that drags on far too long, Uncharted 4 carries on the series’ proud tradition of peerless polish and style, with a great multiplayer component to boot. Most importantly, it’s a gentle sendoff to the rag-tag group of characters we’ve known for nine years. A worthy thief’s end, indeed.<br>

                    Long ago, on some long lost Windows Vista machine, Microsoft's big green army man promised us he'd "finish the fight". Then, 13 years passed, and PC players never found out what happened to Master Chief's merry band of army-lads, floating orbs and squid-faced Keith Davids. Now, with Halo 3's arrival via The Master Chief Collection, the circle is finally complete. The old soldier might be showing a few wrinkles, but the closing act of Bungie's original trilogy still knows how to go out with one hell of a bang.<br>
                    <br>
                    Besides a bump up to higher resolutions and 60fps, Halo 3's visuals have been largely untouched. That's a good thing, I reckon. Halo 2: Anniversary's rework was stunning, but that was an ugly game that needed sprucing up. Halo CE: Anniversary, meanwhile, was a haphazard mess that buried the original's brilliant broad strokes with ill-considered effects and greebly assets.<br>
                    <br>
                    Halo 3 holds up, mostly. Yes, the character models look real rough. Texture quality, particularly on the Earth levels, betrays the game's 2007 release. But christ, if Bungie can't bash out some absolutely stunning vistas. Shattered highways wrap through towns around a vast, drained ocean. Brutalist temples jut out of sweeping deserts, as city-sized cruisers duke it out in the sky. Long before Destiny, Bungie was still best-in-class when it came to jaw-dropping skyboxes.<br>
                    <br>
                    It's my favourite version of the Halo formula. The right amount of weapons on the best lineup of maps, without streamlined loadouts and abilities that would crop up in later games. But as I've found with previous MCC releases, it's not something I'll stick with beyond a light distraction. Rounds, especially on larger modes, linger a little too long—and with teams often finding themselves unbalanced from the start, it can be a chore to sit through a 20-minute game you know you've lost.<br>
