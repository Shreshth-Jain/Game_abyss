                    Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.<br><br>
                    Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.
                    <br><br>
                    Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet. 
                    <br><br>
                    Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.
                    <br><br>
                    Global Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.<br>

                    The first Devil May Cry sparked my love of action games in general, but as the series has gone on it’s kept that place in my heart because they aren’t just about killing every enemy in a room. They’re about how you killed every enemy in a room, expressing yourself in an almost artistic and highly technical dance of swords, guns, and lots of jump cancels. Devil May Cry 5 is the new pinnacle of this particular subset of the genre, thanks to a perfectly paced campaign that mixes in three completely different playstyles, each of which containing enough depth to carry a game of their own; a fun and satisfying story; and quite simply one of the best combat systems you’ll find in video games.<br><br>
                    Devil May Cry 5’s story is somewhat unconventional in that it starts with events that would normally feel like the climax: you’re thrown right into a fight you’re meant to lose. After Dante stays behind to let Nero and a new character named V escape from a super-powered demon king named Urizen, the story jumps around a time period of a couple of months, rotating through perspectives as it tells the present-day story of Dante, Nero, and V, while also explaining the circumstances that led to Urizen’s rise to power and V’s quest to take him down. 
                    <br><br>
                    But the beauty of Devil May Cry 5’s combat is in the depth, creative freedom, and variety its three sets of tools offer. If you’re playing as Nero, those tools are your revvable Red Queen sword, chargeable Blue Rose handgun, a grapple that can pull enemies towards you, and an ever-growing arsenal of Devil Breakers, which are disposable mechanical arms that each provide Nero with new abilities and utility. My favorite, Punchline, shoots out an arm that homes in on an enemy and keeps them in place with quick rocket punches. But the real fun starts when you hold down the Devil Breaker button while Punchline is out, allowing you to jump on top of it and ride it like a hoverboard, knocking enemies up into the air with flips, 360s, and other sick stunts.<br>
                    <br>
                    Staying alive isn’t really the challenge, though. As I said at the start, what I love about Devil May Cry as a series is that it’s not about just killing all the enemies in the room, but how you kill the enemies in the room. Trying to get SSS ranks is a real worthwhile challenge that made up for the lack of base difficulty. To that end, I sprang at every opportunity to buy new techniques, which is rewarding because Devil May Cry 5 is paced in such a way that you are constantly getting new toys at just about every turn – whether it be a new form, weapon, or Devil Breaker – and they all come with their own set of new upgrades. By the end of the story all three of my characters felt like all-powerful gods, with even more upgrades still left to be purchased for my next run in the unlockable Son of Sparda mode, which is essentially New Game+ and where the true challenge of Devil May Cry 5 starts to rear its head.
                    <br><br>
                    Battle royale feels like the main mode in the Warzone package, but there’s another mode on offer that’s in a different genre entirely. Plunder takes place on the same Verdansk map, but there’s no circle, no Gulag, and infinite free respawns. The only goal is to make a bunch of money through killing players and completing contracts. You could compare it to a raid in Escape From Tarkov, but it’s actually closer to the The Division’s PvP Dark Zone mode.<br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, a great combat system isn’t worth much if the enemies aren’t fun to fight, but fortunately Devil May Cry 5’s meet the high standards set by previous games in the series. There’s a great mix of common fodder enemies that allow you to do basically whatever you want to them to build your combos, tanky enemies that require specific tactics to bypass their defenses, and powerful support baddies that can deal big damage from afar and can be very threatening if not brought down quickly. The same goes for bosses, with a few of the later fights being among the strongest the series has seen. There’s a solid variety of them too, with several towering and powerful beasts, others who are agile and elusive, but the best are just straight up one-on-one duels with high-speed action that require quick reflexes and a careful balance of offense and defense.
                    <br><br>
                    The question of which Devil May Cry game is the best has gotten much easier with Devil May Cry 5. The combat is the strongest the series has seen to date, the story does a great job of balancing all three of its main characters and doling out rewarding bits of its mysterious story at an enticing pace, and the unlockable difficulties, sheer number of techniques to earn, and the upcoming free Bloody Palace DLC will provide a ton of incentive for replayability. It’s good to have you back, Dante and Nero<br>
